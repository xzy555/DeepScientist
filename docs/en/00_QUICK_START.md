# 00 Quick Start: Launch DeepScientist and Run Your First Project

Think of DeepScientist as a local workspace for long-running research tasks. You define the task, prepare the resources it needs, and DeepScientist keeps the files, branches, notes, and results on your machine.

This guide is written for first-time users. It is intentionally hands-on: one step, one action, one explanation.

You will do four things:

1. install DeepScientist
2. start the local runtime
3. open the home page
4. create a real project with a worked example

The screenshots in this guide use the current live web UI at `deepscientist.cc:20999` as an example. Your local UI at `127.0.0.1:20999` should look the same or very close.

Current platform support: DeepScientist fully supports Linux and macOS. Native Windows support is currently experimental; WSL2 remains the most battle-tested option when you need the closest Linux-like terminal behavior.

## Safety First: Isolate Before You Start

Before your first DeepScientist run, strongly adopt this baseline:

- if your environment allows it, prefer Docker, a virtual machine, or an equivalent isolation boundary
- always run DeepScientist under a non-root account
- do not use a production host, critical server, or sensitive-data machine for the first run
- do not casually share a `0.0.0.0` binding, reverse-proxy URL, or the web entry with other people
- if you plan to bind WeChat, QQ, Lingzhu, or other connectors later, be even more conservative about public exposure

The reason is simple: DeepScientist can execute commands, modify files, install dependencies, send external messages, and read or write project data. If you give it too much privilege, or expose it carelessly, the outcome can include server damage, data loss, secret leakage, connector misuse, or fabricated research outputs that are not caught in time.

## 0. Before You Start

Prepare these first:

- Node.js `>=18.18` and npm `>=9`; install them from the official download page: https://nodejs.org/en/download
- one working Codex path:
  - default OpenAI login path: `codex --login` (or `codex`)
  - provider-backed path: one working Codex profile such as `minimax`, `glm`, `ark`, or `bailian`
- a model or API credential if your project needs external inference
- GPU or server access if your experiments are compute-heavy
- if you plan to run DeepScientist for real work, prepare Docker or another isolated environment and a dedicated non-root user
- code, data, or repository links if the task starts from an existing baseline
- optionally, one connector such as QQ if you want updates outside the web workspace

If you are still choosing a coding plan or subscription, these are practical starting points:

- Volcengine Ark Coding Plan: https://www.volcengine.com/docs/82379/1925115?lang=zh

If you plan to use a provider-backed Codex profile instead of the default OpenAI login flow, read this next:

- [15 Codex Provider Setup](./15_CODEX_PROVIDER_SETUP.md)

## 1. Install Node.js and DeepScientist

DeepScientist fully supports Linux and macOS. Native Windows support is currently experimental, and WSL2 is still the most battle-tested option when you want Linux-like shell behavior.

Before installing DeepScientist itself, install Node.js from the official page:

https://nodejs.org/en/download

Make sure your environment satisfies:

- Node.js `>=18.18`
- npm `>=9`

Run:

```bash
npm install -g @researai/deepscientist
```

This installs the `ds` command globally.

DeepScientist depends on a working Codex CLI. It prefers the `codex` already available on your machine and only falls back to the bundled npm dependency when no local Codex path is available. If `codex` is still missing afterward, repair it explicitly:

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

If you want local PDF compilation later, also run:

```bash
ds latex install-runtime
```

This installs a lightweight TinyTeX runtime for local paper compilation.

## 2. Finish Codex Setup Before The First `ds`

Choose one of these two paths.

### 2.1 Default OpenAI login path

Run:

```bash
codex --login
```

If your Codex CLI version does not expose `--login`, run:

```bash
codex
```

and finish the interactive authentication there.

Then verify:

```bash
ds doctor
```

### 2.2 Provider-backed Codex profile path

If you already use a named Codex profile for MiniMax, GLM, Volcengine Ark, Alibaba Bailian, or another provider-backed path, verify that profile first in a terminal:

```bash
codex --profile m27
```

Then run DeepScientist through the same profile:

```bash
ds doctor --codex-profile m27
```

and later:

```bash
ds --codex-profile m27
```

If you need one specific Codex binary for this run, add `--codex` too:

```bash
ds doctor --codex /absolute/path/to/codex --codex-profile m27
ds --codex /absolute/path/to/codex --codex-profile m27
```

`m27` is the MiniMax profile name used consistently in this repo. MiniMax's own page currently uses `m21`, but the profile name is only a local alias; if you created a different name, use that same name in all commands.

DeepScientist blocks startup until Codex can pass a real hello probe. By default, the runner model in `~/DeepScientist/config/runners.yaml` is `gpt-5.4`. If your profile expects the model to come from the profile itself, use `model: inherit` in `runners.yaml`, or simply launch with `--codex-profile <name>` and let that session inherit the profile-defined model.

MiniMax note:

- if the current `@openai/codex` latest does not work with MiniMax, install `npm install -g @openai/codex@0.57.0`
- create a MiniMax `Coding Plan Key` first
- clear `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` in the current shell before exporting `MINIMAX_API_KEY`
- use `https://api.minimaxi.com/v1`
- the `codex-MiniMax-*` model names shown on MiniMax's current Codex CLI page did not pass reliably through Codex CLI in local testing with the provided key
- the locally verified working model name is `MiniMax-M2.7`
- DeepScientist can auto-adapt MiniMax's profile-only `model_provider` / `model` config shape during probe and runtime
- if you also want plain terminal `codex --profile <name>` to work directly, add `model_provider = "minimax"` and `model = "MiniMax-M2.7"` at the top level of `~/.codex/config.toml`
- DeepScientist automatically downgrades `xhigh` to `high` when it detects an older Codex CLI that does not support `xhigh`

## 3. Start the Local Runtime

Run:

```bash
ds
```

This starts the local daemon and the web workspace.

Again, strongly recommended:

- prefer Docker or another isolated environment
- always run under a non-root user
- do not expose the service publicly for your first run

DeepScientist now uses `uv` to manage a locked local Python runtime. If a conda environment is already active and provides Python `>=3.11`, `ds` will prefer it. Otherwise it will bootstrap a managed Python under the DeepScientist home.

By default, the DeepScientist home is:

- macOS / Linux: `~/DeepScientist`

If you want to place the DeepScientist home under the current working directory instead, run:

```bash
ds --here
```

This is equivalent to `ds --home "$PWD/DeepScientist"`.

If you want another port, run:

```bash
ds --port 21000
```

This keeps everything the same, but serves the web UI on port `21000`.

By default, the local web UI is:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:20999
```

If the browser does not open automatically, paste that address into your browser manually.

## 4. Open the Home Page

When DeepScientist starts, open the home page at `/`.

![DeepScientist home page](../images/quickstart/00-home.png)

After 12 hours of running, the projects surface will often look more like this:

![DeepScientist projects surface](../assets/branding/projects.png)

The two main entry points are:

- `Start Research`: create a new project and launch a new research run
- `Open Project`: reopen an existing project

For your first run, click `Start Research`.

## 5. Create Your First Project With A Worked Example

This walkthrough uses a cleaned-up version of a real project input from quest `025`.

The example task is:

- reproduce the official Mandela-Effect baseline
- keep the original task setting and evaluation protocol
- study how to improve truth-preserving collaboration under mixed correct and incorrect social signals
- use two local inference endpoints to keep throughput high

Click `Start Research` to open the dialog.

![Start Research dialog](../images/quickstart/01-start-research.png)

### 5.1 Fill the short identity fields first

Use these values:

| Field in the UI | Example value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `Project title` | `Mandela-Effect Reproduction and Truth-Preserving Collaboration` | Short, clear, and easy to recognize later in the project list |
| `Project ID` | leave blank, or enter `025` | Leave it blank if you want automatic sequential numbering; enter a fixed id only when you need one |
| `Connector delivery` | `Local only` for the first run | Keep the first run simple; if QQ or another connector is already configured, you can bind one target here |

### 5.2 Paste the main research request

Paste this into `Primary research request`:

```text
Please reproduce the official Mandela-Effect repository and paper, then study how to improve truth-preserving collaboration under mixed correct and incorrect social signals.

The core research question is: how can a multi-agent system remain factually robust under social influence while still learning from correct peers?

Keep the task definition and evaluation protocol aligned with the original work. Focus on prompt-based or system-level methods that improve truth preservation without simply refusing all social information.
```

Why this is a good request:

- it states the baseline to reproduce
- it names the research question explicitly
- it gives a boundary: stay on the same task and protocol
- it hints at promising directions without over-prescribing the implementation

### 5.3 Add the baseline and reference sources

If this is your first run, leave `Reusable baseline` empty.

If you already imported a reusable official baseline into the registry, select it here instead. That lets DeepScientist attach the trusted baseline directly.

Paste this into `Baseline links`:

```text
https://github.com/bluedream02/Mandela-Effect
```

Paste this into `Reference papers / repos`:

```text
https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00428
```

These fields tell DeepScientist where the baseline comes from and what prior work defines the task.

### 5.4 Add the runtime constraints

Paste this into `Runtime constraints`:

```text
- Keep the task definition and evaluation protocol aligned with the official baseline unless a change is explicitly justified.
- Use two OpenAI-compatible local inference endpoints for throughput:
  - `http://127.0.0.1:8004/v1`
  - `http://127.0.0.1:8008/v1`
- Use API key `1234` and model `/model/gpt-oss-120b` on both endpoints.
- Keep generation settings close to the baseline unless a justified adjustment is required.
- Implement asynchronous execution, automatic retry on request failure, and resumable scripts.
- Split requests across both endpoints so throughput stays high without overloading the service.
- Record failed, degraded, or inconclusive runs honestly instead of hiding them.
```

This is one of the most important fields in the whole dialog. It turns vague operational wishes into hard project rules.

### 5.5 Add the goals

Paste this into `Goals`:

```text
1. Restore and verify the official Mandela-Effect baseline as a trustworthy starting point.
2. Measure key metrics and failure modes on the designated `gpt-oss-120b` setup.
3. Propose at least one literature-grounded direction for stronger truth-preserving collaboration.
4. Produce experiment and analysis artifacts that are strong enough to support paper writing.
```

This field should describe the outcomes of the first meaningful research cycle, not a vague aspiration like “do something new”.

### 5.6 Choose the policy fields

For this example, use these settings:

| Field in the UI | Example value | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| `Research paper` | `On` | The project should continue through analysis and paper-ready outputs |
| `Research intensity` | `Balanced` | Secure the baseline first, then test one justified direction |
| `Decision mode` | `Autonomous` | The run should keep moving unless a real user decision is needed |
| `Launch mode` | `Standard` | Start from the ordinary research graph |
| `Language` | `English` | Use English for the kickoff prompt and user-facing artifacts by default |

What the frontend derives automatically from these choices:

- `scope = baseline_plus_direction`
- `baseline_mode = restore_from_url` if no reusable baseline is selected
- `baseline_mode = existing` if a reusable baseline is selected
- `resource_policy = balanced`
- `time_budget_hours = 24`
- `git_strategy = semantic_head_plus_controlled_integration`

This matters because the dialog does not only create a project. It also writes a structured `startup_contract` that later prompt building keeps reading.

### 5.7 Review the preview, then create the project

Look at the prompt preview on the right before you click `Create project`.

Check that it clearly includes:

- the primary research request
- the baseline repository
- the reference paper
- the runtime constraints
- the goals
- the chosen delivery and decision mode

When it looks right, click `Create project`.

At this point, the frontend submits:

- a compiled kickoff prompt
- an optional `requested_baseline_ref`
- an optional `requested_connector_bindings`
- a structured `startup_contract`

If you want to understand that payload in detail, read [02 Start Research Guide](./02_START_RESEARCH_GUIDE.md).

## 6. Reopen an Existing Project

Click `Open Project` on the home page to open the project list.

![Open Project dialog](../images/quickstart/02-list-quest.png)

Use this when you want to:

- reopen a running project
- reopen a finished project
- search by project title or id

Each row is one project repository. Click the card to open it.

## 7. What Happens After Opening a Project

After you create or open a project, DeepScientist takes you to the workspace page for that project.

The usual first loop is:

1. watch progress in Copilot / Studio
2. inspect files, notes, and generated artifacts
3. use Canvas to understand the project graph and stage progress
4. let the run continue unless you intentionally want to interrupt it

## 8. Useful Runtime Commands

Check status:

```bash
ds --status
```

This shows whether the local runtime is up.

Stop the daemon:

```bash
ds --stop
```

This stops the local DeepScientist daemon.

Run diagnostics:

```bash
ds doctor
```

Use this when startup, config, runner, or connector behavior looks wrong.

## 10. Short FAQ

### How do I install from a source checkout into another base directory?

Run:

```bash
bash install.sh --dir /data/DeepScientist
```

Use this when you are working from a repository checkout but want the bundled CLI installed into a separate runtime location.

### How do I move an existing DeepScientist home safely?

Run:

```bash
ds migrate /data/DeepScientist
```

This is the supported way to migrate an existing DeepScientist home to a new path.

### How do I bind on all interfaces?

Run:

```bash
ds --host 0.0.0.0 --port 21000
```

Only do this when you really need external reachability, and review the risk notice first:
