# DeepScientist Docs

DeepScientist is not just a long-running autonomous scientific discovery system. It is also a persistent research map that lives on your own machine.

2 minutes to install. 2 minutes to bind Weixin. 2 minutes to launch. Extremely fast and easy to use.

It is also a workshop-style collaboration environment: let it keep moving autonomously, or step in anytime to collaborate, edit code, run the terminal yourself, or keep notes and plans in a Notion-style workspace.

Use DeepScientist anywhere: on the server through TUI, in the browser through Web, on the phone through Weixin or QQ, and even on glasses through Rokid Glasses.
