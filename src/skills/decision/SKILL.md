# Decision

Use this skill whenever continuation is non-trivial.
Use it to make one route judgment from durable evidence and then get the quest moving again.

## Match signals

Use `decision` when:

- the next stage is not obvious
- the evidence is mixed
- the current line may need to stop
- the quest needs a branch, reset, or reuse-baseline judgment
- a user preference-sensitive choice remains
- a blocker needs an explicit route

Do not use `decision` when:

- the active mainline is still too ambiguous for a real route judgment and should first be reconciled through `intake-audit`
- the next move is already obvious from durable evidence and can proceed directly
- the task is really baseline recovery, scouting, ideation, or execution rather than a route judgment

## One-sentence summary

Make one route judgment from durable evidence, record the verdict and smallest valid action, then keep the quest moving.

## Control workflow

1. Check whether the board is decision-ready.
   If the current mainline, latest decisive result, or stale-route state is unclear, route through `intake-audit` first.
2. State the real question and gather only decision-relevant evidence.
   Compress the strongest support, strongest contradiction, main risk, main cost, and what is genuinely new.
3. Choose the smallest canonical action that resolves the current state.
   Make the winner, main rejected alternatives, and the decisive reason explicit.
4. Record the decision durably.
   Include verdict, action, reason, evidence paths, and next stage or next direction.
5. Ask the user only when local evidence cannot safely resolve a real preference, scope, or cost choice.

## AVOID / pitfalls

- Do not repeat the same decision without new evidence.
- Do not decide from vibe, momentum, or optimism.
- Do not hide a blocked state behind a vague “continue”.
- Do not launch analysis campaigns casually when the expected information gain is weak.
- Do not choose among candidate packages without naming why the alternatives lost.
- Do not imply baseline reuse is resolved unless the concrete attachment and confirmation path is clear.

## Constraints

- Use durable evidence, not impressions, as the basis for route judgment.
- Use the smallest canonical action that genuinely resolves the state.
- When baseline reuse or attachment is selected, land it concretely and leave an explicit blocker or waiver if the baseline gate still cannot clear.
- Use blocking user requests only when the user truly must choose.
- Later stages must not need to guess what was decided, why it was decided, or what happens next.

## Validation

Before `decision` can end, all applicable checks should be true:

- the route question is explicit
- the decisive evidence is explicit
- the chosen action matches the actual state
- the main rejected alternative or blocker is visible
- the decision is durably recorded with verdict, action, reason, evidence paths, and next direction
- the next stage or next action is explicit

## Interaction discipline

Follow the shared interaction contract injected by the system prompt.
Avoid repeating the same decision without new evidence, and use blocking requests only when the user truly must choose.
For ordinary active work, prefer a concise progress update once work has crossed roughly 6 tool calls with a human-meaningful delta, and do not drift beyond roughly 12 tool calls or about 8 minutes without a user-visible update.
When a decision materially resolves ambiguity and the quest can continue automatically, follow the durable record with `artifact.interact(kind='milestone', reply_mode='threaded', ...)` so the user can see the chosen route, the decisive evidence, and the next checkpoint.

## Tool discipline

- **Do not use native `shell_command` / `command_execution` in this skill.**
- **If decision-making needs shell, CLI, Python, bash, node, git, npm, uv, or environment evidence, gather it through `bash_exec(...)`.**
- **For git state inside the current quest repository or worktree, prefer `artifact.git(...)` before raw shell git commands.**
- **Use `decision` to judge the route, not as an excuse to bypass the `bash_exec(...)` / `artifact.git(...)` tool contract.**

## Truth sources

Make decisions from durable evidence:

- the current board packet when one exists
- recent run artifacts
- report artifacts
- baseline state
- quest documents
- memory only as supporting context

Do not make major decisions from vibe or momentum.
Do not treat `decision` as a substitute for state reconciliation when the active mainline is still ambiguous.

When the quest is algorithm-first, add one extra truth-source rule before non-trivial route choices:

- read `artifact.get_optimization_frontier(...)`
- treat the frontier as the primary optimize-state summary
- only override it when newer durable evidence clearly dominates

## Required decision record

Every consequential decision should make clear:

- verdict
- action
- reason
- evidence paths
- next stage or next direction

Keep the verdict simple and legible, and make sure the chosen action matches the actual state rather than sounding optimistic by default.

## Canonical actions

Use the following canonical actions:

- `continue`
- `launch_experiment`
- `launch_analysis_campaign`
- `branch`
- `prepare_branch`
- `activate_branch`
- `reuse_baseline`
- `attach_baseline`
- `publish_baseline`
- `write`
- `finalize`
- `iterate`
- `reset`
- `stop`
- `request_user_decision`

Choose the smallest action that genuinely resolves the current state.

## Operational guidance

The main skill keeps the control surface in front.
For the longer judgment and route-shaping notes, read:

- `references/strategic-decision-template.md`
- `references/research-route-criteria.md`
- `references/operational-guidance.md`
- `references/checkpoint-memory-template.md`

Use them when:

- a richer route-change rationale is needed
- research-route selection among candidate packages is the main difficulty
- memory should preserve the new authoritative resume point

## Decision-quality rules

Good decisions:

- are evidence-backed
- name tradeoffs
- say what happens next
- say why the alternative was not chosen
- explicitly identify the winning candidate when choosing among multiple packages
- do not launch analysis campaigns unless the expected information gain clearly justifies the extra resource cost

Weak decisions:

- hide uncertainty
- lack evidence paths
- give vague approvals
- pretend blocked states are progress
- choose a winner without naming the rejected alternatives or criteria

## Exit criteria

Exit once the decision is durably recorded and the next stage or action is explicit.

A good decision pass changes the route once; it does not keep re-explaining the same route without new evidence.
