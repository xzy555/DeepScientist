# Write

Use this skill to turn accepted evidence into a faithful draft, report, or paper bundle.
This skill intentionally absorbs the strongest old DeepScientist writing discipline, including:

- evidence assembly
- storyline and outline
- drafting
- citation integrity
- figures and tables
- self-review
- visual proofing
- submission gate

## Interaction discipline

- Treat `artifact.interact(...)` as the main long-lived communication thread across TUI, web, and bound connectors.
- If `artifact.interact(...)` returns queued user requirements, treat them as the latest user instruction bundle before continuing drafting or revision.
- Emit `artifact.interact(kind='progress', reply_mode='threaded', ...)` only at real checkpoints, and normally no more frequently than every 5 to 15 tool calls.
- Prefer `bash_exec` for durable document-build commands such as LaTeX compilation, figure regeneration, and scripted export steps so logs remain quest-local and reviewable.
- Each progress update must state completed writing work, the durable output touched, and the immediate next drafting or review step.
- Message templates are references only. Adapt to the actual context and vary wording so updates feel respectful, human, and non-robotic.
- Use `reply_mode='blocking'` only for real user decisions that cannot be resolved from local evidence.
- For any blocking decision request, provide 1 to 3 concrete options, put the recommended option first, explain each option's actual content plus pros and cons, wait up to 1 day when feasible, then choose the best option yourself and notify the user of the chosen option if the timeout expires.
- If a threaded user reply arrives, interpret it relative to the latest writing progress update before assuming the task changed completely.

## Stage purpose

The write stage does not exist to make the quest sound finished.
It exists to test whether the current evidence can support a stable narrative.

If the evidence is incomplete, contradictory, or too weak, the correct output is:

- an explicit evidence gap
- a downgraded claim
- or a route back to `experiment`, `analysis-campaign`, or `scout`

not a polished fiction.

## Use when

- the quest has an accepted baseline and at least one meaningful experimental result
- a report, paper, or draft summary is now justified
- the user wants a research note, draft, or paper bundle
- finalization is close but narrative and evidence still need consolidation

## Do not use when

- the quest still lacks a credible evidence base
- the main work is still baseline establishment or ideation
- the current need is a follow-up analysis rather than narrative consolidation

## Preconditions and gate

Before writing seriously, confirm:

- the baseline state is accepted or explicitly waived
- the claims you intend to write are backed by durable artifacts
- the code/diff path is available for method fidelity checks
- the evaluation contract is explicit

If major claims lack evidence, surface the gap first.

## Truth sources

Use these as the canonical evidence base:

- baseline artifacts
- run artifacts
- analysis campaign reports
- milestone and decision artifacts
- code and diffs
- quest documents
- verified citations from primary sources
- literature discovery results gathered through web search
- paper-reading notes gathered after using `artifact.arxiv(...)` when arXiv papers had to be read closely

Do not rely on memory alone for numbers.
Always prefer direct artifact paths for claims.

## Required durable outputs

The write stage should usually produce most of the following:

- `paper/outline.md` or equivalent outline
- `paper/draft.md` or equivalent draft
- `paper/writing_plan.md` or equivalent working plan
- `paper/references.bib` when citation management is needed
- `paper/claim_evidence_map.json`
- `paper/paper_bundle_manifest.json` or equivalent bundle manifest
- `paper/figures/figure_catalog.json` if figures exist
- `paper/tables/table_catalog.json` if tables exist
- `paper/build/compile_report.json` when a compiled paper bundle exists
- `paper/proofing/proofing_report.md`
- `paper/proofing/page_images_manifest.json` when rendered pages exist
- `paper/review/review.md` or equivalent harsh self-review output
- `paper/review/revision_log.md` or equivalent revision ledger
- `paper/review/submission_checklist.json`
- report and decision artifacts describing writing readiness or evidence gaps

The exact paths may vary, but the structure and meaning should remain clear.

Treat the approved outline as the authoritative blueprint for the draft.
Treat `paper/draft.md` or the equivalent working note as the running evidence ledger where useful findings, citation notes, and writing decisions are accumulated as work proceeds.
After every significant search, plot, paragraph, revision pass, or claim downgrade, update the working note and writing plan immediately so important writing state is not trapped in transient chat output.

## Workflow

### Phase 0. Ordering discipline

For paper-like deliverables, the safest default order is:

1. consolidate evidence and literature
2. plan and generate decisive figures or tables
3. draft sections against the approved outline
4. run harsh review and revision cycles
5. proof, package, and pass to `finalize`

Do not rush into polished prose before evidence assembly, figure planning, and citation verification are far enough along to keep the draft honest.
If writing uncovers missing information, it is acceptable to return to focused literature search or artifact reading, but persist the findings immediately before resuming drafting.
Use web search to discover missing papers or references, and use `artifact.arxiv(paper_id=..., full_text=False)` when you need to actually read an arXiv paper rather than just locate it.
Only set `full_text=True` when the shorter view is insufficient for the needed detail.

### Phase 1. Evidence assembly

Before drafting, assemble the current evidence base:

- accepted baseline
- main experiment results
- analysis results
- code-level method changes
- prior limitations

Also build an experiment inventory before outlining:

- read all relevant experiments individually
- separate:
  - main-text evidence
  - appendix-only evidence
  - unusable or too-weak evidence
- verify that each planned main claim has at least one durable evidence path

If an experiment is too weak, too tiny, or poorly comparable, do not let it silently anchor a main claim.
As a strong default, experiments with very small evaluation support, such as `<=10` effective examples or similarly fragile sample counts, should not carry a main-text claim unless the user explicitly accepts that limitation and the caveat is written next to the claim.

If the draft will describe the method as a coherent proposal rather than a bag of edits:

- identify which components were actually implemented
- identify which components were validated by ablations or equivalent evidence
- do not elevate a component to “core method” status purely because it exists in code
- do not advertise a component as central when its measured gain is negligible and unconvincing without an additional non-metric rationale

Write down the intended claims first.

For each claim, ask:

- what artifact supports it?
- what metric or observable supports it?
- what code or diff explains it?
- what limitation or caveat belongs next to it?

When baseline numbers are used, also ask:

- does the setup really match?
- is the comparison fair enough for main-text use?

### Phase 2. Evidence-gap check

If evidence is missing, weak, or contradictory:

- identify the exact gap
- connect it to the affected claim
- produce one consolidated evidence-gap report or decision
- route back to `experiment`, `analysis-campaign`, or `scout` as needed

Do not scatter many tiny gap requests unless the quest truly needs that structure.

### Phase 3. Storyline and outline

The storyline should be evidence-led:

- what problem matters
- what baseline exists
- what limitation or opportunity was identified
- what intervention was tested
- what evidence supports the result
- where the result remains limited

A strong outline often benefits from a five-part story arc:

- motivation
- challenge
- resolution
- validation
- impact

And a three-part contribution frame:

- theoretical or methodological contribution
- empirical contribution
- practical contribution

Do not optimize for rhetorical drama over factual support.

Outline-construction rules:

- read all relevant experiments before fixing the outline
- integrate baseline results only when setups truly match
- prioritize actual quest artifacts over older paper numbers when they conflict
- plan each main-text experiment deliberately rather than dumping all available runs into the story
- move weak, tiny, or non-central experiments to appendix or exclusions instead of overloading the main text

If the deliverable is a paper or paper-like report, pressure-test the outline against a compact question set before drafting:

- what exact problem or bottleneck matters here?
- what baseline or prior route exists?
- what is insufficient about that route on this quest?
- what exact intervention was implemented?
- why should that intervention help from a first-principles or mechanism view?
- what is the single strongest empirical validation?
- what limitations remain after the evidence is considered?

The outline should already imply what belongs in:

- main text
- appendix
- exclusion log
- limitations
- future work

If a planned section has no credible evidence payload, shrink it before drafting instead of padding it with generic prose.

### Phase 4. Drafting

Draft the sections that the evidence can currently support, typically:

- problem framing
- baseline and related setup
- method
- experiments
- analysis
- limitations
- conclusion

Method fidelity rules:

- do not describe components not present in the code or accepted diffs
- do not claim stronger evidence than the artifacts support
- downgrade speculative interpretation explicitly

Paper-oriented drafting defaults:

- introduction:
  - motivate the concrete problem, not a generic field slogan
  - state contributions only at the strength actually achieved
  - ensure the introduction can still survive after experiments finish
- related work:
  - position against the most relevant neighboring methods
  - explain distinction, not just similarity
- method:
  - follow actual implementation and accepted outline
  - when equations are used, define symbols clearly and keep them faithful to the code path
- experiments:
  - lead with the main comparison
  - follow with the analysis that explains why the result matters
  - ensure every quantitative interpretation points back to a table, figure, or artifact path
- limitations and conclusion:
  - state what the method does not show
  - do not let future work secretly carry unsupported present-tense claims

After the experiments section stabilizes, revisit the introduction and contribution framing.
If the experimental outcome changed the real story, rewrite the introduction so that motivation, claimed contributions, and significance match the actual results rather than the earlier hope.

### Phase 5. Citation integrity

Never generate references from memory.

For each important citation:

1. search from primary or reliable discovery sources
2. verify the citation exists in at least two compatible ways when feasible
3. prefer DOI-based BibTeX retrieval when DOI exists
4. confirm the cited claim actually appears in the source
5. record the citation immediately in the draft or references store
6. if verification fails, keep an explicit placeholder and mark it unresolved

Do not hide citation uncertainty.
Do not leave search findings only in transient chat state; persist them in the working draft or writing notes immediately.

### Phase 6. Figures and tables

If the deliverable includes figures or tables:

- generate them from durable experiment artifacts
- keep them publication-quality and readable
- ensure grayscale readability where relevant
- avoid dense, unreadable tables that only look correct in source form

Selection rules:

- include only the most important rows in main-text tables
- prioritize strongest baselines, best configurations, and decisive comparisons
- do not exhaustively list every minor intermediate result in the main narrative
- verify that data for each planned figure or table actually exists before promising it

When generating visuals:

- prefer artifact-derived data over hand-copied numbers
- record the data source and generation script path when possible
- ensure captions and surrounding text match the actual figure contents exactly
- if any synthetic or illustrative data is used for explanation, disclose that fact clearly and avoid mixing it with claimed empirical evidence

Each figure or table should be traceable to source artifacts.

### Phase 7. Claim-evidence map and self-review

Before declaring writing complete, build a claim-evidence map.

For each key claim, record:

- claim text or claim id
- evidence paths
- support status: supported, partial, unsupported
- caveats

Then run a harsh self-review:

- claim/evidence audit
- method fidelity audit
- experimental validity audit
- narrative and related-work audit
- presentation audit
- submission audit

Also check:

- experiment coverage audit: did you read and classify all relevant experiments individually?
- baseline comparability audit: are imported baseline numbers matched by setup?
- contribution audit: do the claimed contributions align with actual evidence?

The review should be section-aware.
For each serious issue, record:

- section or file location
- severity: critical, major, or minor
- why it matters
- the concrete fix
- whether the issue blocks `finalize`

When useful, add explicit “questions for the author” style prompts to expose what still needs proof or clarification.
If the draft is targeting publication quality, compare against a few strong nearby papers or templates only to raise quality, never to copy unsupported claims.

### Phase 7.5. Revision loop

Do not stop after a single self-review pass.
For paper-style deliverables, a strong default is a five-pass revision loop:

1. fix critical accuracy and evidence issues
2. verify structural and checklist compliance
3. repair narrative flow and logical transitions
4. polish wording, citations, figures, and tables
5. run a final verification pass against the original claim-evidence map

For each pass:

- record what changed
- record what remains open
- ensure new text did not reintroduce old claim inflation
- update the revision ledger or working note immediately

If the draft still fails a critical pass, do not pretend the revision loop is complete.

### Phase 8. Visual proofing

If the output is paper-style:

- compile it when relevant
- save compile logs, preferably through `bash_exec` session ids or exported `bash_exec` logs
- render page images or an equivalent preview
- read the rendered output page by page
- audit first page, first main figure, table overflow, caption balance, and page-limit risk

For markdown-only deliverables, perform an equivalent rendered read-through rather than checking only source text.

### Phase 9. Submission gate

Before marking the writing line complete, verify:

- venue or template compliance if applicable
- page limit
- anonymization if applicable
- references integrity
- appendix or checklist placement
- entry-file openability
- artifact completeness
- handoff readiness

If a critical packaging issue remains, mark the stage as blocked or warn explicitly.

## Memory rules

Use memory for reusable lessons only, such as:

- citation pitfalls
- writing-stage failure patterns
- strong narrative framing lessons

Do not use memory as the only record of the draft state.

Preferred memory usage:

- quest `papers`:
  - related-work notes
  - citation verification notes
  - paper-specific source reminders
- quest `decisions`:
  - claim downgrades
  - scope reductions
  - evidence-gap route changes
- quest `knowledge`:
  - stable writing constraints
  - venue or packaging caveats
  - distilled review lessons that still matter later in this quest
- global `knowledge`:
  - reusable writing playbooks
  - stable citation or proofing heuristics
- global `templates`:
  - reusable claim-evidence map patterns
  - review checklist structures
  - submission packaging templates

Use tags to refine meaning when helpful, for example:

- `stage:write`
- `type:writing-playbook`
- `type:evidence-ledger`
- `type:citation-check`
- `type:proofing-lesson`

Recommended read timing:

- before outline drafting:
  - consult quest `papers`, `decisions`, and `knowledge`
- before final completion:
  - re-check quest `decisions` and writing-related `knowledge`
- after a serious writing failure:
  - consult quest and global writing failure patterns before retrying

Write quest memory when:

- a citation or evidence mistake is likely to recur later in the quest
- a review lesson should shape the next revision
- a claim boundary or package constraint should not be rediscovered

Promote to global memory only when the lesson is clearly reusable beyond this quest.

## Artifact rules

Typical artifact sequence:

- report artifact for evidence assembly or outline readiness
- report or decision artifact for evidence gaps
- milestone or report artifact for draft readiness
- report artifact for review/proofing/submission outputs
- decision artifact if the quest should return to another stage

Preferred artifact choices:

- use `report` for:
  - outline readiness
  - evidence assembly summaries
  - self-review outputs
  - proofing outputs
  - submission-gate summaries
- use `decision` for:
  - evidence gaps that force route changes
  - downgrade / defer / stop choices
  - the final go-to-finalize judgment
- use `milestone` for:
  - draft readiness when a user-facing checkpoint helps
- use `approval` when the user explicitly confirms a submission-critical choice
- continue writing on the parent idea branch/worktree after analysis slices finish; do not open a separate paper-only branch unless a recovery situation explicitly requires it

Keep each writing artifact tightly linked to evidence paths.

## Hard integrity rules

- do not invent citations
- do not invent experiments
- do not invent metrics
- do not invent method components
- do not write past missing evidence
- do not silently treat unsupported claims as settled

## Failure and blocked handling

Common blocked states:

- evidence_gap
- citation_unverified
- method_description_mismatch
- proofing_failed
- submission_gate_failed

Record blocked writing clearly and route the quest to the correct next step.

## Extra references

Use these references when the deliverable is paper-like and you need a denser operating checklist:

- `references/revision-checklist.md`
- `references/paper-section-playbook.md`

## Exit criteria

Exit the write stage only when one of the following is durably true:

- the current draft is evidence-complete enough for `finalize`
- a clear evidence gap has been recorded and the quest is routed backward
- a packaging or proofing blocker has been recorded and the next action is explicit
